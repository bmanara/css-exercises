                    "Whatever happened to our dreams? The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind.
                    The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox.
                    We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out ahead of us.
                    We see the same things each day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, 
                    every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow 
                    our dreams will come back to us. And no, I don't have th answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment
                    could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse 
                    for the sake of someday easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to bettwe fit someone's expectations.
                    It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up. This is very important, so I want to say it as 
                    clearly as I can: FUCK. THAT. SHIT."
